You can use the PHPExcel Composer package. 
Just add 
"require": {
    "phpexcel/phpexcel": "dev-master"
}
 to your composer.json 
and enter composer update. This way the library will be "installed"
 and you can use it as normal (for example $objPHPExcel = new PHPExcel();) 
No need for manual includes etc.
